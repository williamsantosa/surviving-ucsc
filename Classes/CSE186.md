# CSE186 - Full Stack Web Development I

This course examines current uses of the World-Wide Web for delivery of the sophisticated interactive applications we use daily. Web Applications offer several advantages over traditional, locally installable binaries including heterogeneous deployment, instantaneous access, continuous updates, and the possibility of collaboration at scale.
